They could not have been more different, and they would meet only for a short time in 1502, but the events that transpired when they did would significantly alter each man{u2019}s perceptions{u2014}and the course of Western history. In 1502, Italy was riven by conflict, with the city of Florence as the ultimate prize. Machiavelli, the consummate political manipulator, attempted to placate the savage Borgia by volunteering Leonardo to be Borgia{u2019}s chief military engineer. That autumn, the three men embarked together on a brief, perilous, and fateful journey through the mountains, remote villages, and hill towns of the Italian Romagna{u2014}the details of which were revealed in Machiavelli{u2019}s   frequent dispatches and Leonardo{u2019}s meticulous notebooks.  Superbly written and thoroughly researched,  The Artist, the Philosopher, and the Warrior  is a work of narrative genius{u2014}whose subject is the nature of genius itself.  aElectronic reproduction.bNew York :cBantam,d2009.nRequires OverDrive Read (file size: N/A KB) or Adobe Digital Editions (file size: 4892 KB) or Kobo app or compatible Kobo device (file size: N/A KB) or Amazon Kindle (file size: N/A KB). 7aHistory.2OverDrive 0aElectronic books.2 aOverDrive, Inc.,edistributor1 cOriginalz978055380752340uhttp://link.overdrive.com/?websiteID=37&titleID=221845zAccess eNYPL4 3Excerptuhttps://samples.overdrive.com/?crid=405F7724-035F-45D1-8F71-D76ABD9C5240&.epub-sample.overdrive.com4 3Imageuhttps://img1.od-cdn.com/ImageType-100/0111-1/%7B405F7724-035F-45D1-8F71-D76ABD9C5240%7DImg100.jpg4 3Thumbnailuhttps://img1.od-cdn.com/ImageType-200/0111-1/%7B405F7724-035F-45D1-8F71-D76ABD9C5240%7DImg200.jpg  a.b225094216b07-03-21c07-03-2021 19:07  aiab07-03-21cmdz  eafenggnyuh4i1  aOverDrive_ME-083705152nam  2200433Ka 4500001001400000006001900014007001500033008004100048020003500089037008400124040001700208084004500225091001500270100001600285245009900301260001000400300002200410336002600432337002600458338003600484520316500520521004203685521002903727521001703756521002003773533024403793650004204037650003704079655002204116710003404138776002804172856007304200856011304273856010904386856011304495907004404608998004404652901002204696ODN0000267428m        d        cr cn---------120627s2009    nyu     s     000 0 eng d  a9780307547873q(electronic bk)  aA8212504-C69C-408E-AE1E-88F791B3965DbOverDrive, Inc.nhttp://www.overdrive.com  aTEFODcTEFOD  aBIO016000aBIO022000aSPO0430002bisacsh  aeNYPL BOOK1 aCox, Lynne.10aSwimming to antarcticah[electronic resource] :bTales of a long-distance swimmer.cLynne Cox.  c2009.  a1 online resource  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier  a{u2022} At age fourteen, she swam twenty-six miles from Catalina Island to the California mainland. {u2022} At ages fifteen and sixteen, she broke the men's and women's world records for swimming the English Channel{u2014}a thirty-three-mile crossing in nine hours, thirty-six minutes. {u2022} At eighteen, she swam the twenty-mile Cook Strait between North and South Islands of New Zealand, was caught on a massive swell, found herself after five hours farther from the finish than when she started, and still completed the swim. {u2022} She was the first to swim the Strait of Magellan, the most treacherous three-mile stretch of water in the world. {u2022} The first to swim the Bering Strait{u2014}the channel that forms the boundary line between the United States and Russia{u2014}from Alaska to Siberia, thereby opening the U.S.-Soviet border for the first time in forty-eight years, swimming in thirty-eight-degree water in four-foot waves without a shark cage, wet suit, or lanolin grease. {u2022} The first to swim the Cape of Good Hope (a shark emerged from the kelp, its jaws wide open, and was shot as it headed straight for her). In this extraordinary book, the world's most extraordinary distance swimmer writes about her emotional and spiritual need to swim and about the almost mystical act of swimming itself. Lynne Cox trained hard from age nine, working with an Olympic coach, swimming five to twelve miles each day in the Pacific. At age eleven, she swam even when hail made the water "like cold tapioca pudding" and was told she would one day swim the English Channel. Four years later{u2014}not yet out of high school{u2014}she broke the men's and women's world records for the Channel swim. In 1987, she swam the Bering Strait from America to the Soviet Union{u2014}a feat that, according to Gorbachev, helped diminish tensions between Russia and the United States. Lynne Cox's relationship with the water is almost mystical: she describes swimming as flying, and remembers swimming at night through flocks of flying fish the size of mockingbirds, remembers being escorted by a pod of dolphins that came to her off New Zealand. She has a photographic memory of her swims. She tells us how she conceived of, planned, and trained for each, and re-creates for us the experience of swimming (almost) unswimmable bodies of water, including her most recent astonishing one-mile swim to Antarctica in thirty-two-degree water without a wet suit. She tells us how, through training and by taking advantage of her naturally plump physique, she is able to create more heat in the water than she loses. Lynne Cox has swum the Mediterranean, the three-mile Strait of Messina, under the ancient bridges of Kunning Lake, below the old summer palace of the emperor of China in Beijing. Breaking records no longer interests her. She writes about the ways in which these swims instead became vehicles for personal goals, how she sees herself as the lone swimmer among the waves, pitting her courage against the odds, drawn to dangerous places and treacherous waters that, since ancient times, have challenged sailors in ships.
